# Streambake #

## Features ##
- Link the databases between Streambake and Album Collection, so only one copy
  of the same data is stored
- Store album art in the same folder as the music files, use the suffixes
  -front/.front and -back/.back if more than one image is in the folder so you
  can tell which image to display during song/album playback
